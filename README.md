**NORMA-O** is an OWL 2 DL ontology for the formal semantic representation of machine-readable legal norm annotations. It provides a structured vocabulary for publishing, integrating, and reusing annotations derived from regulatory texts, while preserving full traceability to the legal source and accountability for the annotation process.

## What's new in 2.0

Version 2.0 keeps every term of 1.0 and adds the means to state how norms relate to each other and to concrete cases, and to compute what applies, to whom and why:

- **Standard Deontic Logic grounding** — action negation (`isNegationOf`), `Facultative`, `WeakPermission`, and deontic equivalence, contradiction and conflict between norms.
- **Hohfeldian legal positions** — `Duty`, `Claim`, `Privilege` and `NoRight`, with holder, counterparty, correlatives and jural opposites.
- **Roles, parties and cases** — `LegalRole`, `LegalParty`, `RoleAssignment`, `FactPattern`, and `confersRole` for constitutive rules.
- **Defeasibility** — `ExceptionDefeater`, `ConflictDefeater` and `TemporalDefeater`; lex superior, specialis and posterior; normative rank; norm strength; and a prevalence digraph.
- **Counts-as chaining** — `establishesTrigger` lets a constitutive rule establish an institutional fact that conditions regulative norms, so that defeating a classification (e.g. the high-risk classification of the AI Act) withdraws every obligation that depends on it.
- **Derivation module and reference rule set** — the `normad` module and [`deriv/`](release/2.0.0/deriv/) compute the deontic closure, positions, prevalence ordering with cycle detection, per-case applicability and weak permissions.

`norma:exception` is deprecated and `norma:UnderReview` moved to `ReviewStatus`. See [What's new in 2.0](release/2.0.0/WHATS-NEW.md) for the full description, migration guide, worked examples, term catalogue and known limitations.

## Overview

Regulatory requirements are increasingly expected to be machine-readable: traceable to their legal source, classifiable by type and binding force, and queryable in automated compliance pipelines. NORMA-O provides the semantic backbone for this, enabling legal knowledge engineers and developers to publish normative content as structured, interoperable knowledge graph resources.

The ontology models normative content together with the legal context needed to interpret it. It distinguishes between regulative norms (obligations, prohibitions, permissions, recommendations, negative recommendations) and constitutive rules (definitional or classificatory statements), and represents each legal element — agent, action, object, condition, source — as a distinct entity rather than a free-text blob.

Three design principles shape the model:

1. **Explicit conditional applicability** — a `norma:TriggerEvent` links a specific condition outcome to the normative content it activates, following the W3C n-ary relation pattern. This makes branch-sensitive activation queryable rather than buried in unstructured text.
2. **Reuse of established standards** — PROV-O for annotation provenance, ELI for legal resource references, FOAF for agent metadata, and SKOS for controlled classification values.
3. **First-class provenance** — the ontology records not only what a norm says, but who produced the annotation, by what method, and with what review status.

## Methodology: LOT

NORMA-O was developed following the **LOT (Linked Open Terms) methodology** for ontology engineering. LOT is an industrial ontology development process that provides a systematic workflow for building OWL ontologies aligned with Linked Data best practices.

| LOT Activity | Output in NORMA-O |
|---|---|
| Requirements specification | Competency questions (see below) |
| Conceptualisation | Conceptual model — classes, relations, controlled vocabularies |
| Implementation | OWL 2 DL axiomatisation in Turtle and RDF/XML |
| Publication | Persistent IRI (`w3id.org/def/norma-o`), WIDOCO HTML documentation, Zenodo release |
| Evaluation | SPARQL-based CQ evaluation against the EU AI Act ABox |

## Competency Questions

The following competency questions (CQs) guided the ontology design and serve as evaluation criteria. Each CQ can be answered by a SPARQL query over an ABox that instantiates NORMA-O.

| ID | Competency Question |
|---|---|
| CQ1 | What type of normative content does a given annotation represent — a regulative norm (obligation, prohibition, permission, recommendation, or negative recommendation) or a constitutive rule? |
| CQ2 | Under which conditions does a norm apply, and which specific condition outcome activates it? |
| CQ3 | Who is the legal agent bearing the obligation, right, or restriction stated by a norm? |
| CQ4 | What action is required, prohibited, or permitted under the norm? |
| CQ5 | What legal object does the regulated action concern? |
| CQ6 | From which legal source (regulation, directive, article, paragraph) does the norm derive? |
| CQ7 | Who produced the annotation, by which method (manual, automated, semi-automated), and under what review status? |
| CQ8 | What is the binding force (hard law, soft law) and compliance criticality (high, medium, low) of a norm? |
| CQ9 | What is the current lifecycle status of a norm (active, superseded, repealed)? |
| CQ10 | Which normative statements are activated when a given condition outcome holds? |

## Ontology Diagram

The diagram below shows the principal classes and object properties of NORMA-O 2.0. The 1.0 diagram is [here](release/1.0.0/norma-o.svg), and the derivation module's diagram [here](release/2.0.0/norma-o-deriv-v1.svg).

## Scope

The ontology covers the following aspects of legal norm annotations:

- **Regulative norms** — obligations, prohibitions, permissions, recommendations, and negative recommendations
- **Constitutive rules** — statements that define statuses, classifications, or institutional facts
- **Legal conditions and their evaluated outcomes** — including branch-sensitive activation via the `norma:TriggerEvent` n-ary relation pattern
- **Legal agents, actions, objects, and sources**
- **Provenance and annotation metadata** — extraction method, review status, lifecycle status, and source traceability

The ontology does not model procedural or institutional rules beyond what is necessary to contextualise normative content, nor does it encode substantive regulatory knowledge — that is the role of the ABox.
